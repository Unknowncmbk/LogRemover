Project Title: Log Remover
Author: Stephen Bahr (sbahr@bu.edu)
Files: log_remover.py

Project overview:
Write a shell script (in your favorite scripting language for Windows or Linux) 
that can be run daily to search a directory tree and remove all the oldest .log
files to bring the total filesystem utilization down to 80%.

Issues ran into:
- When computing _get_disk_usage(), used space is calculated as total blocks - free blocks * block size. 
	The issue with this is a file is shown in the filesystem as bytes. A 512 byte file is 1/2 a block.
	Therefore in _remove_files(), we should be calculating the number of blocks that we are removing 
	from used, and not just the size of the file.

Design Decisions/Notes:
- The math that calculates diskusage (_get_disk_usage()) is very expensive, so we do not want
to keep calling that function in our remove file loop. Instead, we keep track of used space,
and decrement it when we remove blocks upon log deletion, allowing for simple and efficient
removals.
- Decided that the arguments should only be the path directory, as specificying the utilization
in the arguments could lead to unexpectedly losing all log files.
- Even though this remove .log files from a directory, we still should create and verbose the
.log files we remove. This is why we logged the script.

Program Errors:
- The error is in the project overview. If this script is called when the disk_usage is at 99%,
and we try to remove all log files, this script can bring the disk_usage down to something still above
the threshold. All log files can be deleted as a result, which is extremely bad.
- If a program uses one massive log file, deleting it could be extremely bad.

Improvements:
- Allow for user input on system utilization.
- Allow for user input on pattern matching (not just .log files)
